# Maze Game
The goal is to create a multi-level maze game with moving walls

Trying to re-work it using oop, allowing me to follow the instructions on [Maze Generation: Growing Tree algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm)

# starting-point.js 
- From http://jamisbuck.org/mazes/minecraft.html
